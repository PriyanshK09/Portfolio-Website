## Portfolio Website
A Basic Portfolio Website for myself with help of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and FontAwesome

This is a simple responsive portfolio website.


## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons 

Have a nice day! :D
